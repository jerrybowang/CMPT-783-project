## Problem Definition
During penetration testing and security audits of web applications and websites, discovering the hidden or unauthorized access directories of the target system is a crucial task.

## Initial Idea
To simplify this process, we intend to develop a Web Directory Enumeration Tool that aims to provide fast and accurate directory and file structure identification functionality.

## Functional Requirements (Scope)
1. Directory Enumeration: Implement directory structure enumeration for the target web application, including common directories and potential hidden directories.
2. Dictionary Attack: Provide dictionary attack functionality, allowing users to customize dictionary files to extend or adjust the guessing of directory and file names.
3. Multithreading Support: Enhance the speed of directory enumeration by utilizing multi-threading techniques for more efficient scanning of the target system.
4. HTTP Response Analysis: Analyze the HTTP responses of the target system to determine which directories are valid, which ones do not exist, or which have unauthorized access.
5. Results Reporting: Generate a clear and readable results report displaying the discovered directory and file structure for users to quickly identify potential security risks.
6. User Interface: Provide a simple and intuitive user interface to make the tool accessible to non-expert users.
7. TCP Port Scanning: Scan the open ports given IP
8. Host Discovery: Discover active hosts' IP in the network
9. Configuration Options: Allow users to configure scanning options, including timeout settings, thread count, and other relevant parameters.
